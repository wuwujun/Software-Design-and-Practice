# Task1 #

    Task1 are Software Engineering Homework in the first two week, 
    which includes the skip list, k-m-p algorithm, priority queue, and the matrix transpose.
### SikpList ###
* **Simple option list:**
> `Every option is connected to a particular function.`
 ```c
 printf("### Function Test ###\n");
 ```
	
	
* **Test example:**
> `For convenience, I set a array in code directly:`
 ```c
 int num[7] = {4, 6, 3, 2, 5, 9, 7};
 ```
     > `Use this to initialize the skip list:`
 ```c
 for (i = 1; i < 8; i++)
 {
	l = insert(l, num[i - 1], i);
 }
 ```
